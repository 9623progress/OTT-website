# Online Teaching Tool Website Internship Project

During my one-month internship at Cognifront Private Limited Nashik, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project involving the development of an online teaching tool website. This project was built using a combination of PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Project Overview
The goal of the project was to create a platform that facilitates online teaching and learning. This involved designing a user-friendly interface that allows instructors to easily upload course content and interact with students, and enables students to access course materials.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Design:** Figma

## Internship Experience
One of the highlights of my internship was learning the process of designing a website using Figma. This involved creating wireframes and mockups to visualize the layout and functionality of the website before implementing it. It was a valuable experience that taught me the importance of planning and designing before coding.

## Key Features Implemented
- **Course Content Management:** Instructors can easily upload and manage course content, including videos, documents, and assignments.
- **Student Interaction:** Students can access course materials .
- **User Authentication:** Implemented user authentication to ensure that only registered users can access the website's features by normal login and as well as google login.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensured that the website is responsive and accessible on a variety of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Conclusion
Overall, my internship experience was incredibly rewarding, and I learned a lot about web development, design, and project management. I am grateful for the opportunity to work on such an exciting project and look forward to applying the skills and knowledge I have gained in future projects.
